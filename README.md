# AI License Plate Detection for Toll Stations ðŸš—ðŸŽ¥  

This project is a **computer vision system** designed to **recognize vehicle license plates** using **AI and deep learning**. It leverages **YOLO (You Only Look Once) v8** for object detection and extraction of text from license plates.

## ðŸš€ Features  
âœ… Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR)  
âœ… Real-time processing using OpenCV & YOLO  
âœ… Integration with cloud services (optional) for scalability  
âœ… Export results as structured logs or database entries to be applicable on a toll station
